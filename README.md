# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction-Classification-
The mobile price range prediction classification project involves analyzing mobile phone data to categorize them into different price ranges. The goal is to understand the relationship between mobile phone features and their price ranges, rather than predicting the exact price.

The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. This includes examining the distribution of price ranges, identifying correlations between features and prices, detecting outliers, and identifying trends and patterns in the data.

Next, a classification model is built using machine learning techniques. Algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, SVM, or neural networks can be used. The model is trained on labeled data, where the features are used to predict the corresponding price range category.

The model is evaluated using testing data, and hyperparameters are fine-tuned for optimal performance. Cross-validation techniques may be employed for robust evaluation.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the price range category of new mobile phone data. These predictions provide valuable insights to businesses, helping them understand the factors driving prices and make informed decisions related to pricing strategies, marketing, and product development.

In summary, the project combines EDA, machine learning techniques, and predictive modeling to categorize mobile phones into different price ranges. By leveraging the features of mobile phones, the project enables businesses to gain insights into the pricing dynamics of the mobile phone market and make data-driven decisions.
